# Student Performance Analysis

This project is part of my internship at *OutriX* under the *Data Science domain*.
The goal of this project is to analyze students' academic performance using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn .
We perform *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* to discover factors that affect student grades and visualize meaningful insights from the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset contains student-level information such as:
- Gender
- Parental education level
- Lunch type
- Test preparation course
- Scores in Math, Reading, and Writing

## Tools & Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## âœ… Tasks Performed

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Statistical Summary & Null Value Handling  
4. Correlation Analysis between subjects  
5. Visualizations (bar charts, heatmaps, boxplots)
6. Final Insight Summary

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights

- Students who completed test preparation scored higher on average.
- Parental education level has a slight impact on student performance.
- Female students performed better in reading and writing.
- Math scores had the highest variation among all three subjects.

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

This analysis gives an overview of what factors might affect student performance. 
It also helps in identifying trends useful for education strategists or school policies.
